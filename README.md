## Installation

To get started with Flusso, you can use Docker or Helm to deploy the Ingress Controller in your Kubernetes cluster.

### Docker Installation

1. Pull the Docker image:
   ```sh
   docker pull diocrafts/flusso-ingress-controller:latest
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```sh
   docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 -e SERVER_ADDR="0.0.0.0:8080" -e TLS_ENABLED="true" diocrafts/flusso-ingress-controller
   ```

### Kubernetes Installation with Helm

1. Add your Helm repository (if not added yet):
   ```sh
   helm repo add flusso-repo https://your-helm-repo.com/charts
   ```

2. Install Flusso Ingress Controller:
   ```sh
   helm install flusso-ingress flusso-repo/flusso-ingress
   ```

For more configuration options, refer to the [values.yaml](chart/values.yaml).

---

## Configuration

Flusso supports several configuration options, both via environment variables and Helm chart values.

- **SERVER_ADDR**: Define the address where the Ingress Controller will listen. Default is `0.0.0.0:8080`.
- **TLS_ENABLED**: Enable or disable TLS (default is `true`).
- **TLS_CERT_PATH / TLS_KEY_PATH**: Paths to TLS certificate and key files.

---

## Usage

Flusso automatically routes incoming traffic to Kubernetes services defined by Ingress resources.

### Monitoring

Flusso exposes a web GUI at `http://<controller-ip>:8081` with insights into backends and routing.

---

## Kubernetes Setup

Flusso is designed for seamless integration in Kubernetes.

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes version 1.19 or higher
- Helm version 3 or higher
