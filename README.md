## Installation

Flusso provides two components for deployment: the **Ingress Controller** and the **API Gateway**. You can choose to deploy either or both of them depending on your needs. Both components can be deployed using **Helm** or **Docker**, and here are the instructions for each.

### 1. **Install Ingress Controller using Helm**

To install the Flusso Ingress Controller in your Kubernetes cluster, you can use Helm. Follow these steps:

1. **Add the Flusso Helm Chart repository:**

   ```bash
   helm repo add flusso https://diocrafts.github.io/flusso
   helm repo update
   ```

2. **Install the Ingress Controller:**

   ```bash
   helm install flusso-ingress-controller flusso/flusso-ingress-controller        --namespace ingress-system        --create-namespace
   ```

   This will install the Flusso Ingress Controller in the `ingress-system` namespace. You can customize your deployment by modifying values in the Helm chart.

3. **Verify the deployment:**

   Check the status of the Ingress Controller to ensure it is running:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n ingress-system
   ```

---

### 2. **Install API Gateway using Helm**

To install the Flusso API Gateway in your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:

1. **Add the Flusso Helm Chart repository:**

   ```bash
   helm repo add flusso https://diocrafts.github.io/flusso
   helm repo update
   ```

2. **Install the API Gateway:**

   ```bash
   helm install flusso-api-gateway flusso/flusso-api-gateway        --namespace api-gateway-system        --create-namespace
   ```

   This will install the Flusso API Gateway in the `api-gateway-system` namespace. You can modify the Helm chart values to customize your deployment.

3. **Verify the deployment:**

   Check the status of the API Gateway to ensure it is running:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n api-gateway-system
   ```


---

## Configuration

Flusso supports several configuration options, both via environment variables and Helm chart values.

- **SERVER_ADDR**: Define the address where the Ingress Controller will listen. Default is `0.0.0.0:8080`.
- **TLS_ENABLED**: Enable or disable TLS (default is `true`).
- **TLS_CERT_PATH / TLS_KEY_PATH**: Paths to TLS certificate and key files.

---

## Usage

Flusso automatically routes incoming traffic to Kubernetes services defined by Ingress resources.

### Monitoring

Flusso exposes a web GUI at `http://<controller-ip>:8081` with insights into backends and routing.

---

## Kubernetes Setup

Flusso is designed for seamless integration in Kubernetes.

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes version 1.19 or higher
- Helm version 3 or higher
